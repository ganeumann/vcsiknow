VCs I Know

vcsiknow.py

Pulls all email addresses from your IMAP email account and creates a spreadsheet of all
the people whose emails you have that work for a VC firm. Can take a while to run if you
have a lot of email.
 
This program uses a list of VC:domain mappings kept in a Google spreadsheet. If you find
one is missing, enter it into this form: http://goo.gl/aTwlNY
I will put it in the spreadsheet.

License:

You have my permission to use this code however you want, for free, forever. Be warned,
however, that I am not a professional programmer. In fact, I'm not even a very good
programmer. Actually, I suck. So if the code doesn't work or if it works wrong or even
if it causes your computer to be invaded by thieves and used to create Skynet, or
anything else bad that happens whatsoever, you attest that that's exactly what you
expected to happen, because you took the responsibility to look at the code yourself
and see what it does, so none of those bad things is any surprise at all to you.

If you don't feel entirely confident using this program after reading that, don't.
